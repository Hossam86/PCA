For the following tutorial, we will be working with the famous "Iris" dataset that has been deposited on the UCI machine learning repository
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris).

The iris dataset contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species.

The three classes in the Iris dataset are:

Iris-setosa (n=50)
Iris-versicolor (n=50)
Iris-virginica (n=50)
And the four features of in Iris dataset are:

sepal length in cm
sepal width in cm
